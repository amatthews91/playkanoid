# playkanoid
Arkanoid clone for the PlayDate

# Setup

The following assumes use of VS Code as your IDE for extensions and autocomplete/type checking.

1. Install the [PlayDate SDK](https://play.date/dev/) for your operating system.
  1. The documentation may mention adding `PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH` to your path being optional, I recommend doing so for the next step:
2. Add `__types.lua` from [here](https://github.com/balpha/playdate-types) to your PlayDate SDK root folder and delete `__stubs.lua`
3. Install the [Lua language server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua)
